**Purpose**: Determine the relationship between age and SRH (Self-Rated Health) over time using six datasets.

**Data**: NHIS, BRFSS, MEPS, CPS, NHANES, GSS

**Outputs**: Visualizations and tables of:

1. weighted mean SRH by age group over time. 

2. weighted regression results showing the relationship between age and SRH over time for different age groups.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
source(here::here("R/paths.R")) # To access path for data as depot_path and derived_path
ensure_dirs()

```

# Load data
``````{r}

data_nhis <- readr::read_rds(derived_path("data_nhis.rds")) %>% 
  select(srh, age, year, psu, wt, strata)

```
