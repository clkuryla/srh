## Key Findings

### Variance Explained

| Survey | Outcome | Age % | Period % | Cohort % | P/C Ratio |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| GSS | Continuous SRH | 5.4 | 0.10 | 2.05 | 0.05 |
| GSS | Fair/Poor (Binary) | 5.7 | 0.22 | 2.45 | 0.09 |
| NHANES | Continuous SRH | 5.4 | 0.46 | 0.25 | 1.81 |
| NHANES | Fair/Poor (Binary) | 7.1 | 0.39 | 0.19 | 2.06 |
| MEPS | Continuous SRH | 8.1 | 0.43 | 0.59 | 0.72 |
| MEPS | Fair/Poor (Binary) | 10.5 | 0.68 | 0.36 | 1.89 |
| BRFSS | Continuous SRH | 5.9 | 0.12 | 1.27 | 0.10 |
| BRFSS | Fair/Poor (Binary) | 8.9 | 0.17 | 1.86 | 0.09 |

## Interpretation

- **Age dominates**: Age explains 5-10% of variance across all surveys
- **Period vs Cohort varies by survey**:
  - NHANES, MEPS: Period > Cohort (P/C ratio > 1)
  - GSS, BRFSS: Cohort > Period (P/C ratio < 1)

This pattern suggests different mechanisms may be at play across surveys,
or that the longer time spans in GSS/BRFSS allow cohort effects to emerge.
