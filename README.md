# SRH
Self Rated Health Analysis on 6 Datasets


# Overview

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses and figures for a project on Self Rated Health.

## Data

Due to data use agreements and file size constraints, raw data are not included in this repository.

The project is structured to separate:
  - raw data storage
  - data processing
  - analysis
  - reporting
This avoids data duplication, reduces clutter, and supports reproducibility.

Data access & data depot
### Raw data

This project uses the following datasets:

- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
  - https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html
- Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
  - https://meps.ipums.org/meps/
- National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
  - https://nhis.ipums.org/nhis/
- Current Population Survey (CPS)
  - https://cps.ipums.org/cps/
- National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
  - https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html
- General Social Survey (GSS)
  - https://gss.norc.org/

Users must obtain these datasets directly from the original sources.

### Data depot (external storage)

Raw data are stored outside the repository in a local data depot.

Example structure:

<img width="468" height="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96346755-437b-4864-af67-574135288794" />

This prevents duplication of large files and allows multiple projects to reference the same raw data. See R/paths.R for path helper. 

**One-time setup**
1. Set data depot location

Set an environment variable pointing to your local data depot:

SRH_DATA=/path/to/data_depot


This is done in your .Renviron file (not tracked by git).

Restart R/RStudio after setting this.

2. Install required packages

Install required R packages as needed (see scripts for details).

Folder roles
R/
  Reusable functions and helper utilities (including path management).

data_wrangling_code/

  Scripts that:
  - read raw data from the data depot
  - perform cleaning and recoding
  - save analytic datasets as .rds files (to the data depot)

analysis/

  Scripts that load analytic datasets and run models or computations.
  Markdowns that provide additional information and guide copilot

reports/

  R Markdown/Quarto files that generate figures, tables, and narrative.
  These files load precomputed analytic data and do not perform heavy wrangling.

sandbox/

  Exploratory or experimental code.
  Files here are not required for reproducibility.

Path handling (R/paths.R)

  All scripts use a small helper file to manage paths.

  Key functions:
  
  data_root() — returns the data depot root
  depot_path(...) — paths to raw data
  derived_path(...) — paths to analytic datasets
  ensure_dirs() — creates required output directories
  
  This ensures:
  - no hard-coded machine-specific paths
  - no accidental storage of data inside the repo
  - portability across machines after setup

Reproducing the analysis

  After completing setup:

  1.  Run data processing scripts:
      data_wrangling_code/01_process_dataset1.R, etc

  2. Run analysis scripts (if applicable):

    analysis/01_models.R, etc
    analysis/02_sensitivity.R, etc

  3. Knit the report:

    reports/master.Rmd, etc


  This will reproduce the main figures and tables.

Reproducibility notes

    Raw data are not included due to size and access restrictions.
    
    Analytic datasets are generated by scripts in data-raw/.
    
    Files in sandbox/ are exploratory and not part of the reproducible pipeline.
    
    This repository supports procedural reproducibility: a knowledgeable analyst can reproduce results by following documented steps.
